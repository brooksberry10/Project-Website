    <p>Hello and Welcome!   </p>
    <p>My name is Brooks Berry, and this website is where I will be posting my projects and blogs for a class at FSU. 
      The classes topic is Emerging technologies and Innovation.     </p>

    <p>
    I am originally from Lilburn, GA and I have been living in Tallahassee, FL for almost 8 years.
    I grew up with a lot of interest in sports, art, and music, and later grew into a passion for science and technology.
    
    My love for sports led me to a passion for tennis due to the lessons and habbits I formed from it. 
    While you're out on the court, its you, your opponent, and the elements. Often a battle of mental focus and toughness, and physical endurance and grit. 
    My love for the sport eventually led me to play for a year at Belmont Abbey College, aka the "Red Sea," which was one of the most character-shaping years of my life.  
    I also found joy in becoming a coach, sharing the lessons I had learned to young minds who shared my passion for the sport. 
    I enjoyed coaching during most of my undergrad as well as for many years after, alongside FSU players and coaches with many different backgrounds. 
    During that time I learned invaluable lessons about teamwork, leadership, effort, and sacrafice, 
    which lead me to become a stronger student and life long learner. 
    </P>
    <p>I have always been math and science minded, however when selecting my first degree-path I was drawn to creative and people-minded careers, 
    which is why I chose marketing.
    When I graduated, I decided to stay with my coaching job to help build that business, 
    while also taking other jobs to search for a field related to math and science, which is my true calling. 
    During that time I developed a deep interest in the tech industry and I ended up deciding to attend FSU for a degree in Computer Science!
    I have learned so much during this degree, and I am excited to use what I have learned to create and improve my projects!
