  <p>Hello and Welcome! My name is Brooks Berry, and this website is where you can learn a little bit more about me
  and view some of my creations! </p>
    
 <p> I am originally from Lilburn, GA, just outside of Atlanta. I have been living in tallahassee for almost 8 years! 
  I grew up being interested in sports, art, and music, and eventually grew into a passion for science and technology!</p>
  
  <P>My love for sports as a child lead me to play many sports as a kid, and the sport of tennis became my passion due to its enduring mental and physical nature.
  While you're out on the court, its you, your opponent, and the elements. Often a battle of mental focus and toughness, as well as skill. 
  My love for the sport eventually led me to play for a year at Belmont Abbey College, aka the "Red Sea".  
  It also led me to become a coach and share the lessons I had learned to young and upcoming minds who share passion for the sport. 
  I enjoyed coaching during most of my undergrad as well as for many years after alongside FSU players and coaches. During that time I learned invaluable lessons about
  teamwork, leadership, effort, and sacrafice, which lead me to become a stronger student and life long learner. As for a career, it was only temporary.</P>
    
  <p>In highschool, I was math and science minded, but I grew into a creative and people-minded nature ultimately leading me to choose Marketing as a degree path for my first undergrad degree.
  When I graduated, I decided I didn't want to work in a corporate business setting, and stayed with my coaching job, and tried to help build that business, 
  while also juggling other jobs that I took to search for a different field. While coaching kept me afloat, I was looking into other career paths based in science and math. 
  During that time, I further sparked my interest in the tech industry. I ended up deciding to do a second bachelors degree in Computer Science at FSU. Go Noles!
  I have learned so much during this degree that my brain actually hurts! It's been a good ride, and I have grown to love unlocking software's patential while stimulating my desire to be creative.
  I am excited to continue the journey and make and improve more projects.</p>
