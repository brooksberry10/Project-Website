  <p>Hello and Welcome!   </p>
  <p>My name is Brooks Berry, and this website is where you can learn a little bit more about me
  and view some of my projects.
  I am originally from Lilburn, GA and I have been living in Tallahassee, FL for almost 8 years.
  I grew up with a lot of interest in sports, art, and music, and later grew into a passion for science and technology.
  </p>
  <P>My love for sports led me to a passion for tennis due to the lessons and habbits I formed from it. 
  While you're out on the court, its you, your opponent, and the elements. Often a battle of mental focus and toughness, and physical endurance and grit. 
  My love for the sport eventually led me to play for a year at Belmont Abbey College, aka the "Red Sea," which was one of the most character-shaping years of my life.  
  I also found joy in become a coach, sharing the lessons I had learned to young minds who shared my passion for the sport. 
  I enjoyed coaching during most of my undergrad as well as for many years after, alongside FSU players and coaches with many different backgrounds. 
  During that time I learned invaluable lessons about teamwork, leadership, effort, and sacrafice, 
  which lead me to become a stronger student and life long learner. 
  </P>
  <p>I have always been math and science minded, however when selecting my first degree-path I was drawn to creative and people-minded careers, 
  which is why I chose marketing.
  When I graduated, I decided to stay with my coaching job to help build that business, 
  while also taking other jobs to search for a field related to math and science, which is my true calling. 
  During that time I developed a deep interest in the tech industry and I ended up deciding to attend FSU for a degree in Computer Science!
  I have learned so much during this degree, and I am excited to use what I have learned to create and improve my projects!
