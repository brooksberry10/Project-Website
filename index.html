  <p>Hello and Welcome! My name is Brooks Berry, and this website is where you can learn a little bit more about me
  and view some of my creations! 
  </p>
    
 <p> I am originally from Lilburn, GA, just outside of Atlanta and I have been living in tallahassee for almost 8 years! 
  I grew up being interested in sports, art, and music, and eventually grew into a passion for science and technology.
 </p>
  
  <P>My love for sports as a child led me to the sport of tennis becoming a passion of mine due to the lessons and habbits I formed from it. 
  While you're out on the court, its you, your opponent, and the elements. Often a battle of mental focus and toughness, as well as skill. 
  My love for the sport eventually led me to play for a year at Belmont Abbey College, aka the "Red Sea".  
  It also led me to become a coach and share the lessons I had learned to young and upcoming minds who share my passion for the sport. 
  I enjoyed coaching during most of my undergrad as well as for many years after alongside FSU players and coaches. During that time I learned invaluable lessons about
  teamwork, leadership, effort, and sacrafice, which lead me to become a stronger student and life long learner. As for a career, it was only temporary.
  </P>
    
  <p>In highschool, I was math and science minded, however at the time I was drawn to creative and people-minded careers, which is why I chose Marketing as my first undergraduate degree path.
  When I graduated, I decided to stay with my coaching job, and tried to help build that business, 
  while also juggling other jobs that I took to search for a field related to math and science, my true calling. 
  During that time I developed deep interest in the tech industry and I ended up deciding to do a attend FSU for a degree in Computer Science!
  I have learned so much during this degree! I am excited to learn more and work on creating and improving my projects. 
  </p>
